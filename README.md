Step 1: Install vpython
Open your terminal or command prompt and run this: 
    
			 pip install vpython
		
(If you're using VS Code, Anaconda, or IDLE, make sure you're installing it in the same Python environment you’re running your script from.)


>>>>if it's not working(If You Still Get the Error), then Try running this in the Python interpreter to test:

		 import vpython
	 print("VPython is working!")
	
Your operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux)
How you're running Python (IDLE, VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, etc.)
And I’ll give you the exact command that works in your setup.
